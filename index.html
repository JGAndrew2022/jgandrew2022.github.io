        <p>
          I am a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing dual B.S. degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. My work lies at the intersection of these fields—modeling, scientific computing, optimization, and control—and I am currently applying to Ph.D. programs with an interest in safe and robust control of distributed and nonlinear dynamical systems. I am also interested in partial differential equations, inverse problems, and physics-informed machine learning.
          <br /><br />
          I am an undergraduate research fellow in Dr. Emily Jensen’s lab in Electrical Engineering, where I study the modeling and analysis of wave-like systems with nonlinear dynamics, including soft-bodied robotic crawlers and nonlinear transmission lines. I also spent a summer as a research fellow in the <i>Patterns and PDEs</i> REU at UC Irvine, applying perturbation and stability methods to PDE models of biological self-organization. Across these projects, I have developed a strong interest in using mathematics to understand and control complex physical systems, and I look forward to continuing this work in graduate school.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />I am proficient in programming with MATLAB, Python, and C++, and I have hands-on experience with Linux, git, Jupyter, and Agile methodologies. My academic and research background has also equipped me with strong skills in partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamics, linear algebra, and numerical methods. Prior to focusing on research, I worked on the Linux Platform/DevOps for CU Boulder's Office of Information Technology, where I gained experience writing softwaere for system administration, automation, and monitoring.
          <br />
          <br />My relevant coursework completed at CU includes Nonlinear Control Systems, Partial Differential Equations, Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Matrix Methods, Differential Equations, Operations Research, Calculus I-III, Markov Processes, Discrete Mathematics, Applied Probability, Algorithms, Quantum Algorithms, Advanced Data Science, Theory of Computation, Programming Languages, Computer Systems, Software Development, Intro to AI, and Data Structures. I am currently taking Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing, Stochastic Analysis for Finance, Machine Learning, Software Ethics, and pursuing a senior thesis.
