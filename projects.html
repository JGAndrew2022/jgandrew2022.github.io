    <h2>A System Level Approach to LQR Control of the Diffusion Equation</h2>
    <p>Submitted to <em>2026 American Control Conference</em><br />
       Accepted for Presentation and the 64th IEEE International Conference on Decision and Control <br />
    </p>
    <p><em>
      Abstract — The continuous-time, infinite horizon LQR problem for the diffusion equation over the unit circle with fully distributed actuation is considered. It is well-known that the solution to this problem can be obtained from the solution to an operator-valued algebraic Riccati equation. Here, it is demonstrated that this solution can be equivalently obtained by solving an $H_2$ control problem through a closed-loop design procedure that is analogous to the "System Level Synthesis" methodology previously developed for systems over a discrete spatial domain and/or over a finite time horizon. The presented extension to the continuous spatial domain and continuous and infinite-horizon time setting admits analytical solutions that may complement computational approaches for discrete or finite-horizon settings. It is further illustrated that spatio-temporal constraints on the closed-loop responses can be incorporated into this new formulation in a convex manner.

    <h2>Optimal Control of Soft Robotic Crawlers Subject to Nonlinear Friction:
      A Perturbation Analysis Approach</h2>
    <p>Published in <em>IEEE Control Systems letters</em>, DOI: 10.1109/LCSYS.2025.3581875<br />
       Accepted for Presentation and the 64th IEEE International Conference on Decision and Control <br />

      Abstract —  This paper considers the dynamics of a limbless, soft-robotic crawler, modeled as a nonlinear wave equation, subject to a sliding friction force modeled as an asymmetric and nonlinear function that captures the effects of both wet and dry friction present in physical scenarios. A reduced-order model of the dynamics is formed utilizing perturbation method techniques. This reduced-order model is solved analytically and solutions are validated by comparison to numerical solutions for the full dynamics of a soft-robotic crawler in a sewer pipe. This analytic solution to the reduced-order approximation of the dynamics is utilized to derive expressions for the resulting velocity, energy, mileage (efficiency), and engineering stress of a crawler. Assuming actuation that takes the form of a periodic traveling wave, an open-loop control design problem to maximize velocity subject to mileage and stress constraints is formulated and solved numerically.

    <h2>Senior Thesis Proposal (October, 2025)</h2>
    <p>This paper details the preliminary results and proposed research plan for my senior thesis, "Optimal Design of Nonlinear Periodic Electrical Networks for Soliton Pulse Generation".</p>
    <p><em>
      Abstract —  Nonlinear transmission lines (NLTLs) offer a reliable, low-cost platform for generating high-power RF pulses, but their design remains largely empirical or limited to small-amplitude approximations. This project develops a tractable analytical-computational framework to design nonlinear periodic electrical networks that support soliton pulses with prescribed spectral and temporal properties. Using perturbation methods and soliton theory, a reduced-order continuum ODE model is derived which captures the soliton solutions of the full electrical network. This model is used to formulate an ODE-constrained optimization problem that enables tuning of the network’s dispersion. Expected outcomes include numerical solutions of the proposed optimization problem, verification of these solutions through simulations of the full discrete network, and a general framework that can be used to inform NLTL design.

      <h2>Modeling Momentum in Tennis Matches</h2>
      <p>This paper was written for problem C of the 2024 Mathematical Contest in Modeling, hosted by the Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications. In the paper, my team and I create a mathematical model for momentum in tennis. We then use this model to prove momentum is important in winning a tennis match, and identify key variables that can induce momentum episodes.</p>

      <h2>Formal Model Checking</h2>
      <p>Final project poster for Theory of Computation (CSCI 3434). Model checking is an important practice in engineering and software development to rigorously verify that systems operate as intended. In this project, I give an overview of model checking and its relevance to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Linear Temporal Logic of Knowledge (LTLK). To illustrate model checking via LTL, I present an analysis of the Needham–Schroeder public-key protocol to reproduce the error originally found by Gavin Lowe.</p>
